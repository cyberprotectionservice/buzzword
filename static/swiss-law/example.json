    "intro": "# Swiss law corpus: a sample investigation\n\nThe corpus being investigated is comprised of three books, which have undergone optical character recognition (OCR) via tesseract and parsing via buzz/spaCy.\n\nThe original texts are typset with Fraktur fonts, making the accuracy of OCR far from perfect. In turn, this effects parser accuracy, and thus, it can be expected that no frequency counting will be perfectly accurate.\n\nTo address this, we built the [compare interface](/compare), which allows registered users to edit the results of the OCR process, and also to add annotations in the form of XML tags, which can later be used in the analysis process. Changes made to the OCR are not instantly reflected in the analysis interface; this update is performed manually, following review of submitted corrections.\n\nThe analysis presented here will therefore improve when re-run on increasingly correct versions of the OCR text.\n\nThe first part of this sample analysis is to simply perform a broad 'distant reading' of the texts, in order to provide a context that will aid us in answering a more specific research question: *xxx*.\n\nFirst, we remove non-words from our text. This would not be necessary with a perfect corpus; however, the OCR process results in a number of non-words entering the corpus (for example, from marks and blemishes on the original page). In the analysis interface, this translates to searching for words that match the regular expression `[A-Za-z]{2,}` (i.e., any word containing at least two alphabetical characters in a row).",

You can search for anything you like in the space below. However, for more advanced functionality, you should use the dedicated [explore interface](/explore).",
